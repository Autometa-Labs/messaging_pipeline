# kafka_playground
This repository contains the following components:

- Kafka infrastructure (including Zookeeper)
- Kafka Consumer
- Kafka Producer
- Elastic Search 
- Kibana

Both the consumer and the producer have to be compiled seperately into a jar file and then build using Docker or instead, connect to the other components outside of Docker
